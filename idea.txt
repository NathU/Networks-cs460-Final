A simple multiplayer game over HTTPS

Preso Thoughts:
- Emphasis on the Application Layer 
  - How EXPRESS.JS handles HTTP
  - Logging & Notification/Alerts?
  - PM2 automated process management?
- How NodeJS interacts with Network Layer
- Show the lifetime of a player's TCP connection (in the console log?)
- Discuss SSL Certs thru CertBot & LetsEncrypt (how it works?)
- The lifetime of a multiplayer game... easiest.
- Talk about security! (You'd have to do security for the game)
  - use of encryption in JWT's
  - use of Diffie-Helman group
  - DB encryption???
  - SSL Cert & rating
